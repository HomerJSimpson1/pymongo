changing config servers

only shard the big collections
pre-split if bulk loading
pick shard key with care, they aren't easily changeable
be cognizant of monotonically increasing shard keys
adding a shard is easy but takes time
use logical server names for config servers
don't directly talk to anything except mongos except for dba work
keep non-mongos processes off of 27017 to avoid mistakes
